# Tic-Tac-Toe Project

A project about making a web-based tic-tac-toe game using the module pattern and factory functions.

## Issues

  - Input validations needs work to stop things like users sending equal names or sending empty strings.

  - Alignment needs work: the markers on the board aren't centered for some reason, for example.

  - A bit of responsive design could be added in for the fonts to avoid some resizing issues.
